            <h2># Sizing in CSS</h2>
            <hr class="section-title-divider">
            <br>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    HTML elements have a default size, including height and width. However, CSS can change their size.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Two of the most common sizing properties in CSS are the width and height properties.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For instance, the &lt;img&gt; element has a default width and height set to the original size of the image
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <img
                                src="img/2-cherry-blossom-jelly-mochi.png"
                                alt="Cherry Blossom Jellly Mochi"
                            >
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <img
                                src="img/3-rendered-img-size.png"
                                alt="Rendered Image of the original Image Size of the Cherry Blossom Jellyu Mochi"
                            >
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The above rendered image of Cherry Blossom Jelly Mochi is 478.98 pixels-wide and 377.99 pixels-tall by default. But this can be changed in CSS by selecting the image and setting a differnet width and height
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <img
                                src="img/4-syntax-to-change-width-height.png"
                                alt="Syntax forr changing the width and height of an image"
                                width="250"
                            >
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            This is image would become taller than it is wide.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

            <h2># Absolute vs. Relative Units</h2>
            <hr class="section-title-divider">
            <br>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The kind of measurements given to an element'ss properties cna be splint into two groups: absolute units and relative units.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Absolute units are usually expressed as numbers, with or without a decimal. They are fixed and do not change in size according to the size of its direct parent element.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Pixels(px) are the most commonly used:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <img
                                src="img/5-absolute-units-pixels.png"
                                alt="Absolute units example using Pixels for Sizing"
                                width="250"
                            >
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Other common options include points (pt) and centimeters (cm)
                </li>
                <br>

                <li>
                    Keep in mind that when setting the height of a given element with absolute units, because it may cause the content to overflow outside the boundaries of its parent element.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If an element's property is set with relative units, it will change if the size of something else changes, like its parent element or the computer screen itself.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This is often expressed as percentages (i.e. 50%):
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <img
                                src="img/6-relative-units-percentage.png"
                                alt="Relative units exampled using Percentages for Sizing"
                                width="250"
                            >
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <br>

                <li>
                    There are other frequently-used relative units:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            em measurements that are associated with the font size of either the parent element when applying font-size or the element itself when setting the width.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            rem measurements that are associated with the font-size of the root &lt;html&gt; element (16pt by default)
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Uses for the em may include setting a page's text to change according to how a usesr sets the text size for their browser. For rem, this could be used to set the baseline text size for a site.
                </li>
            </ul>
